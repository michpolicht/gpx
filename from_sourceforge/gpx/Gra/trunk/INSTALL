GPX uses Kitware's CMake as a build system. Basically to create static or dynamic library
you have to:

1. Install CMake
2. Create build directory and chdir into it
3. Call cmake generator (e.g., "cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..")
4. Run make

Refer to CMake documentation for details. More precise instructions will come later.


CMake and MinGW/MSYS.

On older versions of MinGW/MSYS, CMake refuses to link/compile test sources. In order
to work properly it requires recent versions of ld and gcc suite. Versions ld 2.20, 
gcc 3.4.5 were tested on Windows.
