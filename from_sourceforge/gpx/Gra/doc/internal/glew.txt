windows gcc may be not able to privately link to external static library. That is
symbols from that liberary are exported within a compiled library. In order to make
glew private it's required to use glew.c file + define GLEW_STATIC macro. 

Also remember that glew.c may use settings for C compiler in Eclipse. I wasn't able
to compile glew.c correctly, because GLEW_STATIC macro was set only in C++ tab.
